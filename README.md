# K-Nearest-Neighbors

# Overview

This program is designed to perform a K Nearest Neighbors analysis on a dataset of customers from a restauraunt, using SKLearn.

We begin the process by reading in our dataset to a panda dataframe and changing our labeled data to numeric. From here we split our dataframe into attributes and labels. 

Next we begin testing and training our model. We begin our testing with 10 groupings, and then build our predictions.

From here we can interpret the results of our model and we can see that we are above 90% in terms of precision for predicting each category.

With satisfactory scores, we pull in our testing data and begin to test our model and interpreting the results.

I also included an exploratory exercise on performing a KNN analysis without SKLearn for fun.
